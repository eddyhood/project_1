#Sharks, Dragons and Raptors. Make sure the teams have the same number of 
#players on them, and that the experience players are divided equally across the three teams.

#Create a text file named teams.txt that includes the name of a team, 
#followed by the players on that team. List all three teams and their players.

#In the list of teams, include the team name on one line, followed by a separate 
#line for each player. Include the player's name, whether the player has experience 
#playing soccer, and the player's guardian names. Separate each bit of player information by a comma.
